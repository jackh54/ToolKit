## Adding Your Tool

### Tool Structure
- **Categories**: Navigate to the appropriate category folder in `tools/` (e.g., `tools/rgb-utilities/`, `tools/minecraft/`). If your tool doesn't fit into an existing category, consider adding a new category folder.
- **Files**: Each tool should include:
  - `index.html`: Tool-specific HTML.
  - `your-tool-name.js`: Tool-specific JavaScript functionality.
  - If additional styling is necessary, add to the shared `style.css` in `assets/css/` and follow the existing style conventions.

### Tool Requirements
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for tools and files. For example, "RGB Picker" should be in `tools/rgb-utilities/rgb-picker/`.
- **Shared Styling**: All tools use a shared `style.css` to maintain consistency. If additional styles are necessary, add them sparingly and follow the established CSS naming conventions.
- **Documentation**: Each tool should contain a brief usage description at the top of `index.html` or within the tool's code. This ensures users can understand and use the tool effectively.

## Testing Your Tool

1. **Local Testing**: Open `index.html` in a browser to check your tool's functionality and integration with ToolKit.
2. **Validation**: Ensure your tool is responsive, accessible, and compatible with the current site design.
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: If possible, test on multiple browsers to ensure consistency.

2. **Push to Your Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-your-tool-name
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub.
   - Open a pull request from your branch, describing your tool and any key details.
