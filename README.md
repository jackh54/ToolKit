**ToolKit** is an ad-free, community-built website offering a diverse collection of simple, practical tools like RGB pickers, encoders, and other tools created by the community. Designed for easy contribution and user-friendly functionality, ToolKit is your go-to hub for practical web-based utilities.

## About the Project

ToolKit was created to provide a clean, ad-free environment for users to access various tools without the clutter found on many other websites. The site is built with simplicity and accessibility in mind, allowing contributors to easily add new tools and utilities.

## Contributing

ToolKit is a community-driven project, welcoming contributions from anyone with the skills and interest to add valuable tools. We aim to keep the experience consistent, so all tools will use a shared base CSS, with options for minor customizations. To contribute:
1. Clone the repository and create a new branch.
2. Add your tool in the appropriate category directory.
3. Follow the contributing guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
4. Submit a pull request for review.
